## [Inventory and Store System - Part 5.1 (Creating the Player Inventory)](UnityItemSystemPt5.1-PlayerInventory)

In this episode, we are going to create the player's inventory by tying together many of the concepts that we've learned. To start, we'll talk more in depth about the event system as we add interactivity to the UI. From there, we'll use scriptable objects to define the backend data structure for our player's inventory. We'll wrap up by displaying the correct amount of bag slots on the UI. 

## [Inventory and Store System - Part 5.2 (Finishing the Inventory & Buying Equipment)](UnityItemSystemPt5.2-PlayerInventory)

In this episode, we are going to pick up where we left off by wrapping up the logic for displaying items in the players inventory. First, we will fill up the inventory slots with existing items that the player has, then we will populate their currency. After that, we'll make it so that the player can buy items from the merchant by hooking up an onClick event via code.
