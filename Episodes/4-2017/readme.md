## [Inventory and Store System - Part 5.1 (Creating the Player Inventory)](UnityItemSystemPt5.1-PlayerInventory)

In this episode, we are going to create the player's inventory by tying together many of the concepts that we've learned. To start, we'll talk more in depth about the event system as we add interactivity to the UI. From there, we'll use scriptable objects to define the backend data structure for our player's inventory. We'll wrap up by displaying the player's currency and bag space on the UI.
