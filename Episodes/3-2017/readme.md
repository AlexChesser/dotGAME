In this episode, we'll continue our project by building out the store user interface for our player to interact with. We'll go over the foundation needed to work with the UI system in Unity, including examining the Rect Transform and components such as; Canvas, Canvas Scaler, Image, Text and more.

## [Inventory and Store System - Part 4.1 (Wiring up the UI)](UnityItemSystemPt4.1-WiringTheUI)

In this episode, we will continue our project by hooking up basic mechanics to the store UI. We'll cover the concept of coroutines, as we incorporate logic for showing the dialog. We will also create an inventory database for our merchant which sets the stage for the next part of the series: populating the data.

## [Inventory and Store System - Part 4.2 (Populating the Data)](UnityItemSystemPt4.1-WiringTheUI)

In this episode, we are going to wrap up the Store UI in our RPG project. We will focus on populating the data that we've setup with scriptable objects, using various techniques that we have gone over in previous episodes. We'll also tackle some common problems such as clearing out the data from the UI, locking player movement and adding an OnClick event to a button to close the UI.
