# Unity Navigation - Part 2

In this [episode](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/dotGAME/Unity-Navigation-Part-2), we will add the finishing touches to the point and click style movement. We will use [NavMesh Obstacles](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-NavMeshObstacle.html) to define areas that our character should not walk through, such as the well. We'll also show the player where they clicked by animating a simple sprite, instantiating copies of it every time the player clicks and then destroying it once the animation is complete.
