## [Basics of Unity](BasicsOfUnity)

In this episode we will take a look at the basics of using Unity while setting up the scene that we will be working with for the next several episodes. We will discuss the basics of the UI, general terms such as "game object" and  "component" and give a brief introduction into materials. We'll wrap up by taking a quick look at the `Awake()`, `OnEnable()`, `OnDisable()`, `Start()` and `Update()` methods.

## [Unity Navigation - Part 1](UnityNavigationPt1)

In this [episode](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/dotGAME/Unity-Navigation-Part-1) we will add point and click style movement to our character using Unity's Navigation System. More specifically, we will go over baking a navigation mesh, setting up the NavMeshAgent and writing code to make our character move to a position when the user clicks on the ground. This video will also introduce the concept of Raycasting.
