## [Basics of Unity](BasicsOfUnity)

In this episode we will take a look at the basics of using Unity while setting up the scene that we will be working with for the next several episodes. We will discuss the basics of the UI, general terms such as "game object" and  "component" and give a brief introduction into materials. We'll wrap up by taking a quick look at the `Awake()`, `OnEnable()`, `OnDisable()`, `Start()` and `Update()` methods.

## [Unity Navigation - Part 1](UnityNavigationPt1)

In this episode we will add point and click style movement to our character using Unity's Navigation System. More specifically, we will go over baking a navigation mesh, setting up the NavMeshAgent and writing code to make our character move to a position when the user clicks on the ground. This video will also introduce the concept of Raycasting.

## [Unity Navigation - Part 2](UnityNavigationPt2)

In this episode, we will add the finishing touches to the point and click style movement. We will use [NavMesh Obstacles](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-NavMeshObstacle.html) to define areas that our character should not walk through, such as the well. We'll also show the player where they clicked by animating a simple sprite, instantiating copies of it every time the player clicks and then destroying it once the animation is complete.
