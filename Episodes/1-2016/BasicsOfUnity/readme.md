# Unity Basics

In this [episode](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/dotGAME/Basics-of-Unity) we will take a look at the basics of using Unity while setting up the scene that we will be working with for the next several episodes. We will discuss the basics of the UI, general terms such as "game object" and  "component" and give a brief introduction into materials. We'll wrap up by taking a quick look at the `Awake()`, `OnEnable()`, `OnDisable()`, `Start()` and `Update()` methods.
