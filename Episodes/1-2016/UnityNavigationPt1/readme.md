# Unity Navigation - Part 1

In this [episode](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/dotGAME/Unity-Navigation-Part-1) we will add point and click style movement to our character using Unity's Navigation System. More specifically, we will go over baking a navigation mesh, setting up the NavMeshAgent and writing code to make our character move to a position when the user clicks on the ground. This video will also introduce the concept of Raycasting.
